The most authoritative, actual and comprehensive source of the truth, what information the bot is collected and stored, is <a href="https://github.com/kozalosev/DickGrowerBot/tree/main/migrations">database migrations</a>, published, as the rest of the source code, on GitHub.

However, let's take a closer look at the most important parts shortly:
1️⃣ The bot has to store IDs and names of its users to be able to show the top and the results of PvP battles;
2️⃣ The creation date of a user's account is required to provide a welcome bonus, i.e. a grace period of positive growth without shrinks.
3️⃣ Chats IDs are used for users to have different dicks in different chats, and to support the bot to be working in both modes: via commands and inline mode.
4️⃣ Obviously, it's necessary to store lengths, the dates of last growths, and loans info (sum, dates of receipt and repayment, payout rate) per chat.
5️⃣ We collect statistics of won/lost battles, acquired/lost centimeters as an accumulated table, without a full log of all battles.
6️⃣ The full log is collected for:
    ➖ winners of «the Dick of the Day» contest (for statistics purposes, and to determine whether a winner was already chosen today or nor; however, this may be optimized in the future);
    ➖ imports of the data from other bots (to investigate any issues, and to prevent double imports when a command is invoked several times);
    ➖ promo codes activations (for statistics and investigation purposes).
7️⃣ None of the data, described above, is provided to third party organizations, except for:
    ➖ Russian hosting company <a href="https://timeweb.cloud">TimeWeb</a>, providing cloud infrastructure to run the code of applications;
    ➖ French hosting company <a href="https://www.scaleway.com/en/">Scaleway</a>, providing S3 compatible storage to store backups of the database;
    ➖ international company <a href="https://grafana.com">Grafana Labs</a>, in whose cloud infrastructure metrics and logs are stored.
