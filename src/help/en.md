Do you want to have the biggest dick in the world? I'm sure you do. Just /grow it once a day in every chat you're in! Get on the top the rank!

The growth range for the command is between <b>{grow_min}</b> and <b>{grow_max}</b> cm. Use the /top command to show the top of the biggest weapons in a chat.

Also, there is a daily election of <i>the Dick of the Day</i> in every chat. This title brings its owner some bonus centimeters additionally. Only active players who have grown their cucumber at least once in the last week participate in the election.

If you want to make your little bro even longer and is ready to get some risk for this opportunity, you may fight with your friends. Just place a bet via /pvp command! The winner will get the specified number of centimeters. The looser will lose theirs. It's simple.

<b>Wait, I already know similar bots in Telegram and have a very big thing thereâ€¦</b>

This bot has been created as a replacement for all competitors abusing their ability to send messages in group chats by sending indecently large amount of advertising. I swear to never send you a message consisting of advertisement only!

Using the /import command, sent as a reply to a message from another bot, describing positions of the users in its top, any administrator of a chat may import already existing cocks. Currently, the following bots are supported: {other_bots}.

For import to be done successfully, a player must already have a dick in this bot! Both lengths will be summed, so no progress is lost.

<b>The administrator of the chat, I participate in, doesn't allow to add unknown bots, especially with privacy mode disabled</b>

Unfortunately, I had to disable the privacy mode to make the import feature work. Otherwise, Telegram doesn't give the access to the messages sent by the other bots. In the future, however, when this command will be less demanded, it may be removed.

Nevertheless, there is a way to play without the bot being in a chat at all! Just use inline queries! Type the username of the bot after the <code>@</code> sign and a trailing space to get the same commands!

<i>NB!</i> The rating used via inline mode is different from the rating used by the bot added to the chat. The process of their <a href="https://github.com/kozalosev/DickGrowerBot/issues/17">synchronization</a> may be implemented later.

<b>Contacts and links</b>

In case of any problems, write to {admin_username} or create an issue in the source code repository.

The source code of the bot, written in Rust, is available on GitHub under a bit modified MIT license, forbidding the use of the code to create competitor bots or take a commercial profit by any ways: {git_repo}
